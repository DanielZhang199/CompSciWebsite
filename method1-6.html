<p>If you are on this step, you are probably noticing that you are almost done! To finish solving the Last Layer (TM), we just need to move the yellow pieces around,
until they the colours on the side match up. Which would solve the cube. The purpose of the first step of 2-look PLL is to move the corners into the right positions.
Some people may find PLL to be hard, as it involves comparing multiple colours simliar to when we were solving the second layer,
but now is a lot less intuitive where each piece is going to go.</p>
<p>You may be able to solve the first part of PLL by just looking at the 2 algorithms below and figuring it out, but most people have no idea what they are supposed to do on this step.
Fortunately, there are only 3 possible ways for the yellow corners to be scrambled at this point. 
2 corners will be diagonally swapped, or vertically/horizontally swapped, or the corners can be solved (In which case your cube would look like the image above).
You can tell which position your cube is in by looking for the 'headlights', which is when 2 of the same colour point the same way. 
One pair of headlights is a vertical swap algorithm, two headlights mean that the corners are solved already, and no headlights is a diagonal swap.
For the vertical swap, be sure that the headlights face the left.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Explaination:</h2>
<p>The easiest way of doing this step is with only one algorithm. Only learn the 'headlights' (vertical swap) algorithm, and use it regardless of whether or not there are headlights.
If the corners are solved, don't do anything; if there are 'headlights', move the headlights to point to the left and do the algorithm;
 if there are no headlights, do the headlights algorithm anyways and that should create a pair of headlights.
 You move the headlights to the left because they are already solved, and we need to swap the right corners, which is what the headlights algorithm does.</p>
<p>If you want to use the diagonal swap algorithm to save time, you do not need to align the pieces in a specific way for the algorithm to work, as you can always turn the top layer to align the pieces to their corrosponding side.
Both corners can swap diagonally with the same results.</p>

 <p>These are an example of what 'headlights' looks like. Note that the side they are facing is not important; for our purposes, the two orange-yellow corners are considered solved.</p>

 <p>Doing one algorithm over and over with random U layer turns in between will also solve this step eventually, due to the low number of possible cases.</p>
