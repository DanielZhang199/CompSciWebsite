<h1 id="firstelement">The Rubik's Cube-The Most Popular Puzzle in the World* <p class="smalltext">(*I have not verified this claim)</p></h1>

<hr>
<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>
The Rubik's Cube, a.k.a the Magic Cube is a a cube shaped mechanical puzzle invented in 1974 by professor Erno Rubik.
In a 3x3 Rubik's Cube, each of the six faces are covered by colored stickers, usually white, blue, green, orange, red, and yellow. 
In a Rubik's Cube, the center pieces cannot move relative to each other from any turn, this is what defines the 'colour' of each side of the Rubik's cube.
This means that with a traditional colour scheme, white will always be opposite yellow, green opposite blue, and red opposite orange.
The structure of the cube enables each face to turn independently, mixing up the colours. 
For the puzzle to be solved, each face must be returned to the same colour.</p>

<h2>Difficulty:</h2>
<p>The main reason that the Rubik's Cube is so popular is likely due to its paradoxical nature of being simple in design, with 26 pieces, yet it still contains around 43 quintillion different valid positions.
(A quintillion being 1,000,000,000,000,000,000). 
Anyone holding a Rubik's Cube would know what it would look like when solved, but the act of solving it can be nearly impossible without outside help or being really good at making mathmatical models of puzzles.
This makes the Rubik's Cube an iconic symbol of intelligence is pop culture, and many people who can't do it still find solving one to be impressive.
With the right knowledge and practice however, nearly everyone can learn to easily solve the Rubik's Cube in less than a minute.</p>
<p>This site is designed to help you learn how to solve the Rubik's Cube for the first time. However, without knowing any solving methods, people usually get stuck after solving the first side. 
This website will be covering 2 of the most popular methods, the CFOP method and the Beginner's method.</p>

<h2>How to start:</h2>
<p>To begin, first learn about Rubik's Cube <a href="notation.html">notation</a>, which is how we can easily communicate all the possible moves on the cube. 
Then, you can start to learn how to do the <a href="method1.html">Beginner's method</a>. After mastering the Beginner's method, 
if you are still intrested in achieving faster solve times, you can also try practicing the <a href="method2.html">CFOP/Friedich method</a>; which builds on the concepts of the Beginner's method and is also the most commonly used method by speed-solvers.</p>
