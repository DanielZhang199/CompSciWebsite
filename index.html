<h1 id="firstelement">The Rubik's Cube-The Most Popular Puzzle in the World</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>
The Rubik's Cube, a.k.a the Magic Cube is a a cube shaped mechanical puzzle invented in 1974 by professor Erno Rubik.
In a 3x3 Rubik's Cube, each of the six faces are covered by colored stickers, usually white, blue, green, orange, red, and yellow. 
In a Rubik's Cube, the center pieces cannot move relative to each other from any turn, this is what defines the 'colour' of each side of the Rubik's cube.
This means that with a traditional colour scheme, white will always be opposite yellow, green opposite blue, and red opposite orange.
The structure of the cube enables each face to turn independently, mixing up the colours. 
For the puzzle to be solved, each face must be returned to the same colour.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top:10px;">Difficulty:</h2>
<p>The main reason that the Rubik's Cube is so popular is likely due to its paradoxical nature of being incredibably simple in design, with only 21 moving pieces, yet it contains around 43 quintillion different valid positions.
(A quintillion is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000).
Anyone holding a Rubik's Cube would know what it would look like when solved, but the act of solving it can be nearly impossible without outside help or being really good at making mathmatical models of puzzles.
With the right knowledge and practice however, you can easily solve a Rubik's Cube in less than one minute.</p>
<p>This site is designed to help you learn how to solve the Rubik's Cube for the first time, and also for you to continue to improve your solve time to around 15 seconds per solve! (given that you have a good quality Rubik's cube)</p>
<p>There are many methods on how to solve the cube, with varied difficulties. However, without knowing a method in advance, people often get stuck after solving the first side. 
This website will be covering 2 of the most popular methods, the CFOP method and the Beginner's method.</p>
<hr>
<p>To begin, first learn about Rubik's Cube <a href="notation.html">notation</a>, which is how we can easily communicate all the possible moves on the cube. 
Then, you can start to learn how to do the <a href="method1.html">Beginner's method</a>. After mastering the Beginner's method, 
if you are still intrested in achieving faster solve times, you can also try practicing the <a href="method2.html">CFOP/Friedich method</a>; which builds on the concepts of the Beginner's method and is also the most commonly used method by speed-solvers.</p>
