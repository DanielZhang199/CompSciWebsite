<hr>
<img src="images/firstlayer.png" alt="image of finished white layer" class="smallimages">
<p>Finishing the first layer of the Rubik's Cube is still fairly simple and intuitive, but some people might need to follow some short algorithms for this step.
The goal of this step is to finish the white layer. The main mistake that people who don't know how to solve the Rubik's Cube usually make happens on this or the last step.
People who fail this step usually can solve the white side, but the first layer is not intact.
You need to make sure the red, blue, orange, and green faces form a T-shape of the same colour (as shown in the picture), this way you know that the pieces are in the correct position.</p>
<p>Now is a good time to expain the misconception of how pieces work on a Rubik's Cube. 
There is no such thing as solving only 2-5 sides in a proper solve, only solving layer-by-layer (1 or 6 sides are obviously part of a proper solve). 
If you were to take apart a Rubik's Cube, you will notice that there are 3 types of pieces: center, edge, and corners. 
Center pieces cannot move as they are fixed in position by the core, and anchor the their colour to that face. E
Edges have 2 colours and corners have 3 colours, both of the pieces' sticker colours can never change. 
The sticker colours are properties of the piece, and are bound to it until you peel off the stickers in frustration.
When you peel off the stickers and reapply them, there is a high chance of making the cube unsolveable due to freeing the colours from the pieces in a normally impossible way.
This means that when solving a the white side, you must also be sure to solve the first third of the 4 sides bordering the white face.
</p><p>You need to think of each piece as not just a single coloured sticker, but as the colours on each face of the entire piece. 
(i.e. not 'this is a white sticker', instead 'this is the <b>white-orange edge</b> piece' or 'this is the <b>white-red-blue corner</b> piece') </p>
<p>Keeping this in mind, people who are already able to 'solve one side' should be able to finish this step easily.
If you can't solve a side of the Rubik's Cube already, follow the algorithms on this page to do insert the corners, then move on to the next step.</p>

<img src="images/first_layer/example.png" alt="example" class="smallimages">
<h2>Explaination:</h2>

<p>When solving this step you will need to first identify one of the white corner pieces. If it is on the bottom layer (hold the cube white cross up), move the bottom layer so that 
the corner piece is directly below the spot it needs to go. For example, a white-red-green corner would be on the corner position between those 2 colours, as shown by the black piece in the image.
Then, use the correct algorithm to insert the piece. You can also use the same algorithm for every case until it works, this will take no more than 5 tries.
If the piece is already on the top layer, and is either in the wrong spot, or oriented wrong, using any of the algorithms on a non-white corner will replace it and move the white piece to the bottom layer.</p>

<h2>Algorithms:</h2>
<p>Following the instructions to locate and move the corner, there should be only 3 cases:</p>
  <div class="centered">
	<p><img src="images/first_layer/case1.png" alt="case 1" class="caseimageslarge" align="center"> R' D' R
	<img src="images/first_layer/case2.png" alt="case 2" class="caseimageslarge" align="center" id="notintable"> F D F'
	<img src="images/first_layer/case3.png" alt="case 3" class="caseimageslarge" align="center" id="notintable"> R' D2 R D R' D' R</p>
 </div>
 <div class="centered" style="margin:40px;">
 <p style="margin:0px;">Altneratively, you can also do <b>R' D' R D</b> over and over for all cases, if you can't remember the algorithms. (You will not be able complete this guide if you can't do that though).
 It will take 1, 2, or 5 tries depending on corner orientation.</p>
