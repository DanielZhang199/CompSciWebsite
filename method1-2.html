<hr>
<img src="images/firstlayer.png" alt="image of finished white layer" class="smallimages">
<p>Finishing the first layer of the Rubik's Cube is still fairly simple and intuitive, but people unexpirenced may need to follow some short algorithms for this step.
The goal of this step is to finish the white layer; however, the main mistake that people who don't know how to solve more than one face on a Rubik's Cube make happens on this step.
(And to be honest other than the last step, there isn't any other place to make a mistake yet). You need to make sure the red, blue, orange, and green 
faces need to have a T-shape of the same colour (as shown in the picture), this way you know that the pieces are in the correct position. 
As you can't change solve the other sides otherwise, without re-doing the white side.</p>
<p>Now is a good time to expain the misconception of how pieces work, as opposed to how people believe they work. Remeber that there is no such thing as 
solving a side in a full solve, only solving layer-bu-layer. This is because if you were to take apart a Rubik's Cube, you will notice that there are 3 types of pieces: center, edge, and corners. 
Center pieces cannot move as they are fixed in position by the core, and edges have 2 colours, that can never change, and corners have 3 colours. The sticker colours are properties of the piece, and as such, are bound to it forever.
(When you peel off the stickers and reapply them, there is a high chance of making the cube unsolveable due to this)
This means that when 'solving' a the white side, you must also be sure to solve the first third of the 4 sides bordering the white face.
</p><p>You must think of each sticker as not just a single colour, but as the colours on the entire piece. 
(i.e. not 'this is a white piece', instead 'this is <i>the</i> <b>white-orange edge</b> piece' or 'this is <i>the</i> <b>white-red-blue corner</b> piece') </p>
<p>Keeping this in mind, people who are already able to 'solve one side' should be able to finish this step easily.
If you can't solve a side of the Rubik's Cube already, follow the algorithms on this page to do insert the corners, then move on to the next step.</p>

<img src="images/first_layer/example.png" alt="example" class="smallimages">
<h2>Explaination:</h2>

<p>When solving this step you will need to first identify one of the white corner pieces. If it is on the bottom layer (hold the cube white cross up), move the bottom layer so that 
the corner piece is directly below the spot it needs to go. For example, a white-red-green corner would be on the corner position between those 2 colours, as shown by the black piece in the image.
Then, use the correct algorithm to insert the piece. You can also use the same algorithm for every case until it works, this will take no more than 5 tries.
If the piece is already on the top layer, and is either in the wrong spot, or oriented wrong, using any of the algorithms on a non-white corner will replace it and move the white piece to the bottom layer.</p>

<h2>Algorithms:</h2>
<p>Following the instructions to locate and move the corner, there should be only 3 cases:</p>
  <div class="centered">
	<p><img src="images/first_layer/case1.png" alt="case 1" class="caseimageslarge" align="center" id="firstcaseimage"> R' D' R
	<img src="images/first_layer/case2.png" alt="case 2" class="caseimageslarge" align="center"> F D F'
	<img src="images/first_layer/case3.png" alt="case 3" class="caseimageslarge" align="center"> R' D2 R D R' D' R</p>
 </div>
 <div class="centered" style="margin:40px;">
 <p style="margin:0px;">Altneratively, you can also do <b>R' D' R D</b> over and over for all cases, if you can't remember the algorithms. (You will not be able follow this guide later if that's the case).
 It will take 1, 2, or 5 tries depending on corner orientation.</p>
