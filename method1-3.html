<h1 id="firstelement">Beginner's Method-Step 3: Second Layer</h1>
<hr>
<img src="images/secondlayer.png" alt="image of finished second layer" class="smallimages">
<p>The second layer of the Beginner's Method is point in the method where most people begin to be unable to complete intuitively.
However, this step only has 2 algorithms and is probably the easiest step of the solve for people with no prior expirence.
From this step onwards, we will need to turn the cube so that the white side is on the bottom and yellow is on top.</p>
<p>For this step, we need to move the non-yellow and white edge pieces to the correct positions. These pieces are the blue-red, red-green, green-orange, and orange-blue pieces.
(You don't really need to know that, because you will be very familliar with them once you try this step). We will need find a edge piece on the top layer and line it up in the way that the algorithm pictures show.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Right and Left Algorithms:</h2>
<p>Each of the edges can be in one of these 4 cases:</p>
<div class="centered">
  <img src="images/second_layer/example_1.png" alt="image of first case" class="exampleimages">
  <img src="images/second_layer/example_2.png" alt="image of second case" class="exampleimages">
  <img src="images/second_layer/example_3.png" alt="image of thrid case" class="exampleimages">
  <img src="images/second_layer/example_4.png" alt="image of fourth case" class="exampleimages">
</div> 
<p>The 2 algorithms of this step are very simliar, being left and right variations of each other. We can know which one we should use by looking at the top colour of the piece.
 There are 2 important colours that tell you which case you have for the first 2 cases. The colour facing you on the side piece you are trying to insert deterimines which side you should move the piece
 to. Hold that side, green in this case, in front. Then, look at the colour on the top of the edge you are trying to insert. In this case, the colour can be red or orange (red is opposite orange). This 
 colour determines which side (use either the left or right algorithms) that you should move to piece to.</p>
<p>In case the edge you choose in already in the middle layer but flipped or in the wrong spot, like in the 2 other cases, skip it.
If it is the last case, or all the remaining edges are also flipped or in the wrong spot, use the algorithm to insert another piece into that spot instead, (as only non-important pieces remain)
and the important edge piece should be on the top layer now.
