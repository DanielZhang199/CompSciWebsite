<hr>
 <img src="images/cfopcross.png" alt="image of finished white cross" class="smallimages">
<p>If you are on this page, I would assume that you are already familliar with the solving the Beginner's method's <a href="method1-1.html">white cross</a> already, and this step is very simliar.
The goal is to form a cross at the bottom of the Rubik's Cube in a way that the colours on the sides of the first layer match the centre pieces of the second layer; 
note that you do not have to start on the white side if there is another side that is in a more solved position. Starting on any colour size may take a few weeks to get used to at first.
By now, you should be able to solve the cross intuitively, instead of relying of algorithms, which can allow you to solve this step in much fewer steps.
You should practice this step until you can easily form a cross on a side of a Rubik's cube in 8 moves or less, which is always possible.
 </p>
<p>Experienced cubers almost always memorize the moves for this step when they inspect the cube before each solve. 
Before you attempt your solve, try to memorize the sequence of moves to solve the cross on the fastest side.
As solving the cross does not need you to memorize algorithms, you should practice solving this step quickly with as little moves as possible.</p>

<hr id="twentypxmargintop">
<h1>Tips for a faster cross:</h1>

<h2>Hold the white face down:</h2>
<p>Hold your cube in your hands with the white centre facing down to improve your solution time. 
With a lot of practice you won't need to see the white cross because you will know what's going on down there according to the color scheme of your puzzle, 
your moves and what you see on the top. This way you don't have to turn your cube around, saving a lot of time.</p>
<p>Also, solving the cross on the bottom side can allow you to look ahead to the next step (F2L).</p>

<h2>Work on efficiency:</h2>
<p>Many people tend to rush the cross, leading them to make more inefficient moves, taking up more time overall.
 Work on solving the cross slowly with as little moves as possible; with enough practice, you will soon be able to execute those moves much faster.</p>

<h2>Practice colour neutrality:</h2>
<p>The term colour neutral means that you are able to solve the cube starting and ending with any colour. 
For example, while most people have to start on the white cross for their solves, colour neutral solvers are able to start on the side that has the most favourable position.
While this concept doesn't sound difficult, some tend to struggle with colour neutrality and find it not worth the split-second that it can shave off.</p>
